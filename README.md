NPM (LaunchBar 6 Action)
--------------------------------

![NPM LaunchBar 6 Action](npm.gif)

This **NPM** action allows you to query [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) for NPM packages. It then shows you a result-set of matching packages with their descriptions, allowing you to open any of them in your browser.

## Installation

Clone/download this repository's master and double-click the *NPM.lnbaction*. LaunchBar will then prompt you, whether you'd want to install it.

## Usage

Type *npm* and **NPM** should then appear. Press the *Space* key and type in a package name (e.g. *webp*) - then simply wait a few seconds. Press the *Enter* key to open the chosen package in your browser (-> *npmjs.com*).
